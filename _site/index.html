    <h1>Welcome to My Home on the Internet</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm <strong>Dr. Mathai Fenn</strong> ‚Äî a cognitive psychologist, educator, and explorer of insight.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, my journey has woven together the rigour of science with the wonder of human growth. I‚Äôve taught at institutions across India, the Middle East, and Europe, including <strong>XLRI</strong>, <strong>IIM Kozhikode</strong>, <strong>IIT Gandhinagar</strong>, and the <strong>American University of Armenia</strong>. My work draws deeply from <strong>cognitive science</strong>, <strong>Gestalt theory</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and the <strong>philosophy of learning</strong> ‚Äî but always returns to the simple, timeless question: <em>How do we live well and wisely in a changing world?</em></p>
