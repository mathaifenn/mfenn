<h1>Welcome to My Home on the Internet</h1>
<h2>Dr. Mathai Fenn</h2>
<ul>
<li>PhD from IIT Bombay cognitive psychology and</li>
<li>ten years as faculty member at XLRI Jamshedpur, where I also headed the Organizational Behaviour (some universities call it &quot;management&quot;) dept.</li>
<li>Chief Learning Officer at AiRK, an AI training company in Abu Dhabi</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past three decades, my journey has woven together the rigour of science with the wonder of human growth. I’ve taught at institutions across India, the Middle East, and Europe, including <strong>XLRI</strong>, <strong>IIM Kozhikode</strong>, <strong>IIT Gandhinagar</strong>, and the <strong>American University of Armenia</strong>. My work draws deeply from <strong>cognitive science</strong>, <strong>Gestalt theory</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and the <strong>philosophy of learning</strong> — but always returns to the simple, timeless question: <em>How do we live well and wisely in a changing world?</em></p>

<h2>My Work Touches Many Worlds:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>🧠 <strong>Psychology &amp; Learning</strong><br>
Designing transformative education models that go beyond rote — into reflection, insight, and self-knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤖 <strong>AI &amp; Human Systems</strong><br>
Helping individuals and organizations adapt to intelligent technologies with wisdom and clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏡 <strong>Sustainability &amp; Community Living</strong><br>
Co-creating real-world models like <strong>Fenn Hall</strong> and <strong>Fenn Farm</strong>, where learning, ecology, and shared life converge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✨ <strong>Spiritual Inquiry &amp; Christian Mysticism</strong><br>
Rooted in a non-dual, inclusive understanding of God — one that is loving, beautiful, and alive in all things.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>More Than a Profession</h2>
<p>This site is my <strong>digital porch</strong> — a place where essays, ideas, and conversations can gather. You’ll find blog posts, reflections, experiments with AI, notes on philosophy, and glimpses into a life that seeks meaning in both thought and action.</p>

<p><em>“Let the form be light, and the function be deep.”</em></p>
